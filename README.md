# Frontend Mentor - Browser extensions manager UI

![Design preview for the Browser extensions manager UI coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

A responsive, light/dark mode toggleable UI for managing browser extensions.
Built as my first self-driven frontend project by researching, learning, and implementing features from scratch.
